    """Process the OpenStudio Standards Material dictionary and write out a clean version.

    Specifically, this method performs the following cleaning operations:

        * Output resulting dictionary in a format with the name of the Material
            as the key and the dictionary of the material properties as the values.
        * Remove all material properties with None values. This reduces the file size
            to roughly a quarter of what it is normally.
        * Remove all materials from 'CEC Title24' since they are not used by any of the
            constructions or construction sets of ASHRAE 90.1.
        * Remove the 5 skylight frame materials, which do not have enough data to create
            complete energy materials.
        * Add a series of Typical Insulation materials with increasing R-value, which
            will be used to create code compliant constructions in the _construction_set
            module.

    Args:
        source_filename: The full path to the material JSON in the OpenStudio
            standards gem. If the standards gem repo has been downloaded to one's
            machine this file is likely in a location like the following:
                C:/Users/[USERNAME]/Documents/GitHub/openstudio-standards/lib/\
openstudio-standards/standards/ashrae_90_1/data/ashrae_90_1.materials.json
        dest_directory: The destination directory into which clean JSONs will be written.
            If you are trying to update the files within the honeybee_standards repo,
            you likely want to write to the following location:
                C:/Users/[USERNAME]/Documents/GitHub/honeybee-standards/honeybee_standards/data/
